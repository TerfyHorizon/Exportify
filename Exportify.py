Exportify - README

Exportify is a tool that allows you to export Spotify playlists to a text file.

Getting Started:
================
1. Obtain your Spotify API credentials:
   a. Go to https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications
   b. Log in with your Spotify account.
   c. Click 'Create an App' and fill in the required details.
   d. After creating the app, you'll receive a 'Client ID' and 'Client Secret'.
   e. Copy and paste these into the 'exportify_config.json' file created by the tool.

2. Run Exportify:
   - On first run (double-click), Exportify will generate the 'exportify_config.json' file and create the necessary directories.
   - Edit this file to include your Spotify credentials.
   - After setup, run Exportify from the command line with the Spotify playlist URL to export the playlist.

Usage:
======
   Exportify.exe <Spotify Playlist URL>

Example:
========
   Exportify.exe https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5ZQsZWjg49ke0IvsmcuAQB

Modes of Operation:
===================
1. **Double-Click Setup Mode**:
   - If you double-click `Exportify.exe` (without providing any command-line arguments), it will perform the initial setup.
   - This includes creating necessary directories in your Documents folder (`Documents/Exportify` and `Documents/Exportify/Playlists`), and generating the `exportify_config.json` and `README.txt` files if they don't exist.

2. **Command-Line Export Mode**:
   - Once setup is complete, run `Exportify.exe` from the command line with a Spotify playlist URL to export the playlist.
   - The playlist's tracks will be saved to a text file in the `Documents/Exportify/Playlists` directory.

Notes:
======
- The playlist tracks will be saved to a text file named after the playlist.
- Ensure that you have an active internet connection when using Exportify.
- Cache Warnings: You may see cache-related warnings like "Couldn't read/write token to cache." These warnings are normal and do not affect the functionality of Exportify.

Adding Exportify to PATH (Optional):
====================================
Adding Exportify.exe to your system's PATH allows you to run Exportify from any command prompt without needing to navigate to its directory.

1. Locate the Directory of Exportify.exe:
   - Find the folder where Exportify.exe is located (e.g., C:\\Users\\YourUsername\\Documents\\Exportify\\dist).
   - Copy the full directory path.

2. Open System Properties:
   - Right-click the Start Menu and select "System".
   - Click "Advanced system settings" on the right side to open the System Properties window.

3. Edit the Environment Variables:
   - In the System Properties window, click the "Environment Variables" button.
   - Under "System variables", find and select the Path variable, then click "Edit".

4. Add the Directory to PATH:
   - In the Edit Environment Variable window, click "New".
   - Paste the directory path you copied earlier.
   - Click "OK" to close each window.

5. Verify the Addition:
   - Open a new command prompt (important to refresh the environment variables).
   - Type "Exportify" and press Enter. If itâ€™s been added to PATH correctly, it should run without needing to specify the full path.

Once added, you can run Exportify from any command prompt by simply typing "Exportify".
